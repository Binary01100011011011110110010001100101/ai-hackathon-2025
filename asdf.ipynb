      "I'm going to give it to you straight, Emily Johnson and Emily Wilson. Your applications have some strengths, but they also have significant weaknesses that need to be addressed if you want to stand out in the highly competitive pool of top-tier college applicants.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Academic Record:**\n",
      "Both of you have solid GPAs, but they're not exceptional. A 3.8 or 3.9 weighted GPA is good, but it's not going to blow anyone away. To be competitive, you need to aim for a 4.0 or very close to it. Your course sequences are also somewhat predictable and lack depth in certain areas. For example, Emily Johnson, your math sequence is strong, but you only took one year of foreign language. Emily Wilson, your science sequence is weaker than Emily Johnson's, with only two AP courses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Test Scores:**\n",
      "Your standardized test scores are decent, but they're not impressive. A 1450 or 1480 SAT score is good, but it's not going to get you into the most competitive schools. You need to aim for at least a 1500 or higher. Your ACT scores are also middling, with Emily Johnson scoring a 34 and Emily Wilson scoring a 33. To be competitive, you need to score at least a 35 or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Extracurriculars:**\n",
      "Your extracurricular activities are somewhat scattered and lack depth. Emily Johnson, being the captain of the debate team is great, but what did you accomplish in that role? Did you lead your team to any significant victories or awards? Your involvement in soccer, volleyball, and the school play is also superficial. What specific skills or lessons did you learn from these activities? Emily Wilson, being a member of student council, debate team, and school newspaper is good, but again, what specific contributions did you make to these organizations?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Leadership:**\n",
      "Neither of you has demonstrated significant leadership experience. Being the captain of the debate team or an alternate captain is not enough. You need to show that you can lead a team, manage projects, and achieve tangible results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Awards:**\n",
      "Your awards are minimal and lack prestige. Being a National Honor Society member is good, but it's not unique. You need to win more competitive awards or recognition that showcases your exceptional talent or achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Community Impact:**\n",
      "Your community service hours are decent, but they're not impressive. 200 or 150 hours is a good start, but you need to demonstrate a deeper commitment to serving your community. What specific impact did you make? Did you lead any volunteer projects or initiatives?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Narrative:**\n",
      "Your applications lack a clear narrative thread. What are your passions? What drives you? What do you want to achieve in college and beyond? You need to craft a compelling story that showcases your unique strengths, interests, and goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's a comprehensive plan to address these weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Academic Record:**\n",
      "\t* Take more challenging courses in your areas of interest.\n",
      "\t* Aim for a 4.0 weighted GPA or higher.\n",
      "\t* Consider taking online courses or attending summer programs to demonstrate your commitment to academic excellence.\n",
      "2. **Test Scores:**\n",
      "\t* Use SAT/ACT prep platforms like Khan Academy, College Board, or Magoosh to improve your scores.\n",
      "\t* Aim for at least a 1500 SAT score or a 35 ACT score.\n",
      "3. **Extracurriculars:**\n",
      "\t* Focus on one or two activities that you're truly passionate about and demonstrate depth and commitment.\n",
      "\t* Take on leadership roles or initiate projects that showcase your skills and talents.\n",
      "4. **Leadership:**\n",
      "\t* Seek out opportunities to lead teams, manage projects, or mentor others.\n",
      "\t* Develop a portfolio of your leadership experiences and achievements.\n",
      "5. **Awards:**\n",
      "\t* Research and apply for more competitive awards or recognition in your areas of interest.\n",
      "\t* Consider participating in academic competitions, science fairs, or other events that can demonstrate your exceptional talent.\n",
      "6. **Community Impact:**\n",
      "\t* Develop a deeper commitment to serving your community by leading volunteer projects or initiatives.\n",
      "\t* Partner with local organizations or businesses to create meaningful impact.\n",
      "7. **Overall Narrative:**\n",
      "\t* Craft a compelling story that showcases your unique strengths, interests, and goals.\n",
      "\t* Use specific examples and anecdotes to demonstrate your passions and achievements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended resources:\n",
      "\n",
      "* SAT/ACT prep platforms: Khan Academy, College Board, Magoosh\n",
      "* Online courses: Coursera, edX, MIT OpenCourseWare\n",
      "* Volunteer programs: American Red Cross, Local Food Bank, Habitat for Humanity\n",
      "* Research journals or competitions: Science Olympiad, National Science Fair, Harvard University's Research Opportunities\n",
      "\n",
      "Measurable targets:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Improve SAT scores by at least 100 points within the next 6 months.\n",
      "* Achieve a 4.0 weighted GPA or higher by the end of the school year.\n",
      "* Develop a portfolio of leadership experiences and achievements within the next 9 months.\n",
      "* Win at least one competitive award or recognition within the next 12 months.\n",
      "* Complete at least 500 hours of community service within the next 18 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expect to see significant progress from both of you. Remember, it's not just about checking boxes; it's about demonstrating depth, commitment, and exceptional achievement.\n"
